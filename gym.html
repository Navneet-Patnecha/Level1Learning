     <h2>The best fitness websites to manage a business</h2>
     <p>Your fitness website is where you introduce yourself, your certifications and your specialty. It’s also where you convey the values of your business, highlight your offerings and show off your physical space if you have one.

 

        But a fitness website can be so much more than a resume or a visual hub that represents your brand. In fact, the best fitness websites double as business tools, helping you manage your class schedule, bookings and payments, while engaging with clients and fostering a sense of community.
        
         
        
        It sounds like a lot, but trust us, that’s a good thing. If you need some inspo to get started, check out the best fitness websites built with Wix. Each website is unique to the specialization it supports, but they all have one thing in common: successfully managing a fitness business.

     <h3><ol><li>Best branded bookings experience: Sweat FXBG</li></ol></h3>
     <p>Sweat FXBG offers HIIT, indoor cycling, barre, rowing and yoga at their Virginia-based boutique fitness studio. Owners Carrick and Robin wanted to create a cohesive brand experience—not just a gym—complete with murals on the walls and community-building instructors, which are clearly displayed on their website. That’s also why they used the Wix Branded App to offer their clients a mobile app experience that’s aligned with their brand identity. Clients download the Sweat FXBG app for a cohesive brand experience even before stepping into the studio itself.</p>

Consider this approach if you have multiple locations or platforms.</p>
